**The Boring App — Zero Data Collection**

Last updated: January 3, 2026

---

## Our Philosophy

The Boring App exists to help you do nothing. It does not exist to collect your data.

---

## Data Collection

**We collect nothing. Zero. Zilch.**

- No personal information
- No usage analytics
- No device identifiers
- No location data
- No contact lists
- No browsing history
- No timer history
- No statistics
- No crash reports (intentionally)

---

## Technical Implementation

The app is designed with privacy as a core architectural principle:

### What We Don't Do
- No third-party analytics SDKs
- No advertising frameworks
- No social media integration
- No cloud sync or backup of any kind
- No push notification servers tracking your device
- No user accounts or authentication
- No "anonymous" tracking tokens

### What The App Does
- Runs a local timer on your device
- Shows timer on lock screen (using native platform APIs only)
- Stores settings locally (if any) in device storage only

### Platform-Specific Notes

**iOS Live Activities**
- Timer data stays on device
- Live Activity displays only on lock screen/Dynamic Island
- No data transmitted to Apple's servers beyond what's required for Live Activity to function

**Android Foreground Service**
- Timer notification runs locally
- No data transmitted to Google's servers

---

## Permissions

The app requests the minimum permissions required:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Notifications | Timer completion alert (optional) |
| Foreground Service | Keep timer running when app is backgrounded (Android) |
| Activity Recognition | Not requested (we don't track you) |

---

## Third-Party Services

We do not use any third-party services that collect data.

- No analytics providers
- No advertising networks
- No crash reporting services
- No cloud infrastructure

---

## Children’s Privacy

The Boring App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We will never update this policy to begin collecting data. If we ever did (we won't), we would notify you.

The app may receive minor updates for bug fixes or new features, but our commitment to zero data collection is absolute and permanent.

---

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, you're welcome to reach out—but don't expect a response. We're too busy doing nothing.

*The most private app is the one that collects nothing.*
